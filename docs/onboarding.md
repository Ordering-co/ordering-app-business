# Ordering Business App onboarding

Technical reference for local preview, manual setup and normal native launches. Use the [README](../README.md) for the short agent-led path.

## Source, toolchain and pinned dependencies

The README prompt identifies the original repository for this product. Customer checkouts use the public distribution at `https://github.com/Ordering-co/ordering-app-business.git`, without requiring internal repository access. Reuse an existing checkout after checking `git remote -v`, branch and `git status --short`; preserve its changes. If no suitable checkout exists, clone recursively into a new directory. Do not reset or overwrite existing work.

```sh
# Only when a new checkout is needed:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ordering-co/ordering-app-business.git
cd ordering-app-business
```

Use the pinned SDK submodule supplied by the public checkout. No separate private SDK clone or private organization access is required; keep its recorded gitlink and submodule metadata.

This is a bare React Native 0.81.1 app (not Expo), with React 19.1.0, TypeScript and styled-components/native. Use Node >=20.19.4 (Node 22 recommended), Yarn 1, Ruby 3.3.10, Bundler 2.7.1 and CocoaPods 1.16.2. iOS needs macOS and Xcode; [React Native 0.81 requires Xcode 16.1 or later](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81). Select tools for this checkout without changing global defaults. Keep dependency versions, the SDK gitlink, notices, licenses and native app IDs pinned. The [manual setup](#manual-setup) commands initialize the recorded submodule and install frozen dependencies; never use submodule `--remote` for setup.

The Podfile raises old pod deployment targets to React Native's existing `min_ios_version_supported` (15.1 for 0.81.1), preserving higher targets. This avoids Xcode 27 rejecting legacy 12.x/13.x targets. The Podfile SHA1 must match its `PODFILE CHECKSUM` footer in `ios/Podfile.lock`; preserve locked dependency versions. The Podfile explicitly selects `businessApp.xcodeproj`, so CocoaPods still uses the normal app when a local preview has also generated a `.ordering-local-*` project. Leave both projects in place; no temporary renaming/removal is needed. This uses CocoaPods' documented [project selector](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#project).

Use `bundle _2.7.1_ exec pod install --deployment`. A stale specs catalog may require `--repo-update` with the same locked versions; this is not `pod update`.

## Manual setup

Start from the existing checkout selected above. From its root:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

For iOS, activate the pinned Ruby/Bundler versions, then install pods:

```sh
bundle _2.7.1_ install
cd ios
bundle _2.7.1_ exec pod install --deployment
cd ..
```

Continue with [local preview](#local-preview-without-firebase) for interface work without provider setup, or [normal iOS/Android setup](#normal-iosandroid-setup) for your configured integrations. Android setup does not need the iOS Ruby/Pods step. See the [React Native environment guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) and [CocoaPods getting started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for platform installation.

## Local preview without Firebase

After dependencies/pods are ready:

```sh
yarn ordering:ios-local --without-firebase --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG
```

Success means the actual native screen shows `Local preview · project: YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG`, Home and Login, and a visible edit appears through Fast Refresh. A successful build alone does not verify the screen.

The adapter is deliberately opt-in and accepts only a Debug iOS Simulator build. It rejects release/device/configuration overrides. It validates the project through the shared public helper using a temporary copy of `src/config.json`. Neither the source JSON nor Firebase registrations are replaced.

It generates ignored `.ordering-local-*` projects next to the original iOS project, retaining relative source paths. Only the generated app target omits the missing Firebase plist resource and Crashlytics upload phase. The normal project retains both. The native process consumes `ORDERING_LOCAL_SIMULATOR=1` only under `DEBUG && targetEnvironment(simulator)`. It resets the UserDefaults marker on every launch, passes only validated public project/API fields to JavaScript and selects this checkout's Metro port without persisting a new normal bundle location. JavaScript also requires `__DEV__`, iOS and the native marker. React Native exposes the NSNumber marker as 1; only boolean true or numeric 1 enable it, never strings. Release/normal launches remain on the original path.

Runtime selection happens before owned-device reuse. The adapter queries the selected Xcode through `xcrun --find simctl` and `simctl list runtimes/devicetypes/devices --json`. Automatic selection orders numeric runtime versions newest first, requires availability and host architecture support, and checks each iPhone type against the runtime's `supportedDeviceTypes` plus type minimum/maximum runtime metadata. Older simctl metadata without a whitelist must provide compatible type bounds; missing compatibility is not guessed. A cached older simulator never overrides this policy.

Use an explicit installed version or identifier when you intentionally need an older runtime:

```sh
yarn ordering:ios-local --without-firebase --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --runtime 26.0
# Equivalent exact identifier:
yarn ordering:ios-local --without-firebase --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --runtime com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-26-0
```

An unavailable, ambiguous or incompatible explicit runtime fails clearly; the helper does not fall back or download runtimes. It reuses a saved UDID only within the selected runtime when the recorded checkout/name, actual name, availability and compatible device type all match. Otherwise it creates another owned device and preserves the previous simulator without shutdown, erase or deletion. Previous ownership bytes remain under `.ordering-setup/ios-local/simulator-history/`, with a warning; the current record includes runtime, device type and selected Xcode metadata. Do not suppress macOS CrashReporter or restart unrelated devices to hide a runtime failure. Selecting a newer runtime is separate from proving that the app launches or that an operating-system crash is fixed.

A dedicated simulator is recorded by UDID and checkout; the adapter does not reuse someone else's simulator by name. Repeated runs reuse Metro only after verifying PID arguments, working directory and HTTP status. It does not stop other servers or overwrite a live owned Metro record. State is private to `.ordering-setup/ios-local` (0700), with public selection, logs and ownership metadata; never add credentials there. If the desktop Simulator app is absent, the native process still runs headlessly and can be inspected with device tooling. Verify the actual screen separately from `BUILD SUCCEEDED`.

The local project banner must match your selected slug. The preview disables Firebase messaging/background handlers, OneSignal setup, push token registration and automatic offline queue replay. Google Maps initialization is skipped in local preview; normal mode keeps the existing service registration. Maps require separately configured services. Normal email/password Ordering login is separate from Firebase and still requires your own account/role; no agent credential is copied to the app.

For other public API settings, use `--api-url`, `--api-version` and `--language`. If changing an already selected project, add `--confirm-project-change`. A local preview is not a release, provider registration check or proof of backend membership.

## Public project setup for normal launches

An existing Ordering connection can identify the project through read operations. Reuse the existing connection flow; do not build another developer login. Without a connector, use the manual slug path:

```sh
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs detect
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs configure --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG
# Only if your project uses different public API settings:
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs configure --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --api-url https://YOUR_API --api-version v400 --language en
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs doctor
git diff -- src/config.json
```

The helper performs `GET <api.url>/<api.version>/<api.language>/<project>/current`, requiring JSON with `error:false` and the exact project code. An HTTP 200 HTML response or a different project is rejected before writing. It changes `project`, API fields you explicitly pass and the `localProjectConfigured: true` development marker. IDs, sockets, existing feature flags and unrelated settings remain intact. Backups under `.ordering-setup` contain public configuration, not session credentials. Project existence does not establish account access.

For a fully manual path, back up the JSON locally, edit only `project` and explicit API fields, and inspect the public response:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error 'https://YOUR_API/v400/en/YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG/current'
```

Check `error:false` and `result.code` exactly. Never paste admin API keys, MCP tokens, passwords or private signing files into source, logs or frontend config.

## Normal iOS/Android setup

Normal launches and releases require your own approved service registrations and signing. Preserve the existing native identifiers and team configuration; the explicit local preview skips these integrations.

- Firebase: use the appropriate `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` in target `businessApp` and `android/app/google-services.json` matching the bundle/package. `FirebaseApp.configure()` remains required outside local mode. `firebase.json` contains behavior settings, not an app registration; the public distribution does not supply your provider registrations.
- Maps: replace native placeholders such as `_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_` in the Android manifest and iOS AppDelegate with your own restricted keys for the matching native app. Configure your own backend Google credentials where an enabled integration needs them.
- OneSignal: configure your app, notification extension, push entitlements and shared app group. Both targets must use the same group; set its value consistently in their entitlement files.
- Signing and identity: keep `builder.json`, `app.json`, native projects and schemes consistent. Use the correct bundle/package identifiers, Apple development team and provisioning profiles, plus your own Android release signing. The public distribution's standard React Native `debug.keystore` is only for local debugging. Keep private credentials, signing files and production keystores out of new source commits.

After [manual dependency setup](#manual-setup), start Metro:

```sh
yarn start
# Another terminal, with your normal service registrations ready:
yarn ios
# Or use a configured Android emulator/device:
yarn android
```

The normal projects can also be built directly in Xcode or Android Studio after services and signing are configured. Metro serves JavaScript; it does not produce an APK/IPA or verify login, orders, payments, location or notifications. Real account workflows need your own Ordering project with the relevant API/socket services enabled.

Android requires JDK 17/`JAVA_HOME`, SDK Platform 36, Build Tools 36.0.0, NDK 27.1.12297006 and `ANDROID_HOME`/platform-tools. Check `java -version`, `adb devices` and local SDK paths, then `yarn android`. The build and workflow limits above also apply to Android.

### Business-specific integrations

Printing requires your own compatible hardware and settings. Do not print or accept/change orders as a connectivity check. Push requires your own Firebase/OneSignal settings and device permissions. Local preview is intended for interface work; it does not validate printing or operational order flows.

## First visible edit

Inspect Home and the local banner. Temporarily change `Local preview` to `My first local edit` in `src/onboarding/local-simulator-banner.tsx`. Confirm the changed text on the actual simulator with Fast Refresh, then restore only that text. This exercise needs no account or backend write. For broader interface work, `App.tsx` is the entrypoint; see the application structure below for UI ownership. [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh) updates saved edits. Use the React Native Dev Menu’s Reload action when a deliberate state reset is needed; do not count a full reload as Fast Refresh evidence. A bundle/test success is not appearance evidence; retain before/after screenshots or accessibility snapshots. You may open Login to inspect the email/password fields without entering credentials or submitting.

## Switch, disconnect and recover

Review/finish offline work and log out of the previous account before changing projects. Do not replay old work to another tenant.

```sh
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs configure --project ANOTHER_PROJECT --confirm-project-change
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs doctor
# For the temporary local preview:
yarn ordering:ios-local --without-firebase --project ANOTHER_PROJECT --confirm-project-change
```

Close/reopen the app after a project/API change; Fast Refresh alone is insufficient for session boundaries. Only explicit development setup (`localProjectConfigured: true`, written by the setup helper) or the opt-in local simulator enables project isolation. A historical source project alone preserves the normal development selector, token and offline work. When opted in, the configured `project` wins over stored `project_name`. Before mounting the development SDK tree, the app compares project, API URL/version and local-preview identity with the stored scope. A different/unscoped session is cleared locally; cached orders and pending actions are preserved outside replay keys under `ordering_onboarding_quarantine_<timestamp>`. Those records may contain order data: do not share/export them or requeue them automatically. Language/tutorial preferences and unrelated settings are preserved. Local preview never adopts a normal session, even for the same project. Development storage failures leave the SDK unmounted. Release preserves the original project selector flag, saved project and session behavior; it does not run the new development migration or delay the original SDK tree behind a setup/network check.

Use Logout to disconnect a user account. To remove a normal source selection, restore the helper's public-config backup or restore your previous project selection manually with the app closed. This does not restore a session or send actions:

```sh
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs restore --backup PATH_TO_BACKUP
node scripts/onboarding/cli.mjs doctor
```

If setup fails, inspect its error and the focused config diff. Do not replace the whole file or run `git reset --hard`. The local adapter does not change the source selection; a normal launch without its native flag resets the local marker and resumes normal Firebase requirements.

## Diagnosis and updates

| Symptom | Check/action |
|---|---|
| Wrong project/configuration | Run public `doctor`; verify exact project code and local banner. |
| SDK import missing | Initialize the pinned submodule, without `--remote`. |
| Ruby/Pods incompatible | Use Ruby 3.3.10/Bundler 2.7.1/Pods1.16.2; preserve pinned versions. |
| Simulator never becomes visible | Read the local build/Metro logs and inspect the recorded UDID; a Booted status alone is insufficient. |
| Missing Firebase/GOOGLE_APP_ID | Normal mode needs your own registration; use the explicit local adapter to inspect UI without Firebase. |
| Native link failure | Preserve the exact final log; do not attribute every failure to Firebase or update packages speculatively. |
| Login rejected | Verify project and administrator or business owner (levels 0 and 2) permissions using your own credentials. |
| Maps/push/printing/location unavailable | Configure and separately test your own services/hardware; the preview does not validate them. |


For a Metro cache problem, inspect the existing server’s ownership before using `yarn start:reset`. A cache reset does not supply missing provider registrations. See [React Native troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) for native/Metro diagnosis.

For code updates, preserve local changes, fetch the intended remote branch and combine it using your repository's merge policy. Initialize the parent revision's gitlink, reinstall with frozen Yarn/Bundler locks and reinstall pods when native code changes. Repeat public doctor, local screen checks and the README checks. Do not use generic dependency upgrades, `pod update` or submodule `--remote` as onboarding repairs. Publishing/signing a release is outside this preview workflow.

## Development checks and translations

Run checks from the repository root when changing application code:

```sh
yarn exec tsc --noEmit
yarn lint:check
node --test scripts/onboarding/*.test.mjs
yarn test --maxWorkers=2 --watchman=false
yarn test:coverage --maxWorkers=2 --watchman=false
yarn test:coverage:summary --no-run
yarn i18n:verify
yarn i18n:check-generated
```

`yarn lint` applies automatic fixes; `lint:check` only reports. Type checking and linting can reveal existing app/SDK diagnostics: distinguish those from a new regression. Coverage uses `jest/coverage-include.js`; the summary gate requires a 70% average across statements, branches, functions and its line-count fallback. Unit mocks and coverage do not replace native screen or authenticated workflow checks.

`i18n/translations.json` is the locale catalog. Use `yarn i18n:generate` for derived files and see [translation maintenance](../i18n/README.md). Preserve existing translated values; review English fallbacks in other locales before distribution. `i18n:sync` is a dry run; `i18n:sync:live` writes server data and requires separate authorization and credentials.

## JavaScript bundle inspection

To inspect bundles without launching a device:

```sh
mkdir -p build
yarn react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output build/android.jsbundle --assets-dest build/android-assets --max-workers 2
yarn react-native bundle --platform ios --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output build/ios.jsbundle --assets-dest build/ios-assets --max-workers 2
```

Bundling does not validate an APK/IPA, native signing, provider registrations or the selected backend’s behavior. Login, deliveries, maps, push, printing and other operational flows require separate checks with your own services, hardware and account. Preserve existing SDK, dependency and asset licenses/notices when distributing builds.

## Application structure and references

The headless SDK is pinned at `src/@/components`; UI belongs in `src/ui`, with thin screen/navigation wiring in `src/pages` and `src/navigators`.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/@/components` | Pinned headless controllers and hooks (`@components`) |
| `src/ui` | Presentational UI (`@ui`) |
| `src/pages` | Screen wrappers |
| `src/navigators` | Navigation |
| `src/config.json` | Project, API, socket, language, app name and feature settings |
| `src/theme.json` | Theme and visual assets |

Public identifiers and endpoint defaults do not grant backend account access. React Native was bootstrapped with the [Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
