# Ordering Business App

## Start with an agent

Copy this prompt into your coding agent:

> Clone https://github.com/Ordering-co/ordering-app-business.git into a new folder with pinned submodules. Preserve existing work. Read README and help me launch Business App for my Ordering project in a local simulator without Firebase. Reuse my Ordering connection or accept my project slug. Verify the selected project and one visible edit.

## See the app without Firebase

You can inspect Home, open the login form and edit the interface using an explicit **local iOS Simulator preview**. It uses your validated public Ordering project and skips Firebase setup. It does not create a Firebase project or copy another team's configuration.

1. Use your Ordering project slug. Reuse an existing agent connection, or provide the slug manually; configuring the app does not sign you in.
2. Clone into a new folder and install pinned dependencies. If a checkout exists, verify its remote and preserve its changes.
3. Start the local preview:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ordering-co/ordering-app-business.git
cd ordering-app-business
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
# With the repository's Ruby/Bundler versions active:
bundle _2.7.1_ install
cd ios
bundle _2.7.1_ exec pod install --deployment
cd ..
yarn ordering:ios-local --without-firebase --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG
```

4. Success means the native app opens and shows **Local preview · project: YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG**, Home and Login. Verify a visible change with Fast Refresh. On hosts without the Simulator desktop app, inspect the running simulator through device tooling; a successful build alone is insufficient.

Local preview disables Firebase, push registration and automatic offline replay. Maps need your own keys for real use. Login with your own **administrator or business owner (levels 0 and 2)** account is a separate check; public project validation does not grant access. Release builds and normal launches retain their original Firebase requirements.

## Requirements and manual setup

React Native 0.81.1, React 19.1.0 and TypeScript; a public SDK submodule is pinned at `src/@/components`.

- Node **>=20.19.4** (Node 22 recommended) and Yarn Classic 1.22.
- iOS: macOS, Xcode **>=16.1**, Ruby **3.3.10**, Bundler **2.7.1** and CocoaPods **1.16.2** from `Gemfile.lock`.
- Android: JDK 17, SDK Platform 36, Build Tools 36.0.0 and NDK 27.1.12297006 as declared in `android/build.gradle`.

See the [full onboarding runbook](docs/onboarding.md) for public configuration, normal Firebase setup, Android, diagnosis, switching/disconnecting projects and updates. The [verification record](docs/onboarding-verification.md) separates JavaScript tests, native builds and visible screens. React Native's [0.81 release requirements](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81) and [environment guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.81/set-up-your-environment) provide toolchain details.

## Checks

```sh
yarn lint:check
yarn exec tsc --noEmit
yarn test:coverage --runInBand --watchman=false
yarn test:coverage:summary --no-run
node --test scripts/onboarding/core.test.mjs scripts/onboarding/ios-local.test.mjs
yarn i18n:verify
yarn i18n:check-generated
```

`yarn lint` fixes files; `lint:check` only reports. See [i18n/README.md](i18n/README.md) for translation maintenance. Local checks require no backend credentials; `i18n:sync:live` writes server data and needs a separate authorization.

The app is distributed under [license-ordering.txt](license-ordering.txt). The SDK, dependencies, assets and notices retain their respective licenses.
